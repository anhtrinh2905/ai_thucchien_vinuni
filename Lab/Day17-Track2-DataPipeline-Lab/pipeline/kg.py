"""Bonus (§13) — Knowledge Graph construction from unstructured docs.

Vector RAG retrieves *chunks*; a knowledge graph retrieves *connected facts*,
which is what wins multi-hop and global-summary questions (GraphRAG-Bench,
ICLR'26). The construction pipeline is the same shape regardless of extractor:

    text -> extract (entity, relation, entity) triples -> upsert into a graph

Here the extractor is a small **deterministic** rule matcher so the lab stays
zero-key and reproducible. In production this node is an LLM (e.g. LangChain
`LLMGraphTransformer`) with entity resolution — swap `extract_triples` and the
rest of the pipeline is unchanged. That substitutability is the lesson.
